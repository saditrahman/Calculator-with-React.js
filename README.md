# Calculator with React.js

I created this basic calculator while working on a React.js course from Udemy.

It works perfectly on a local machine.

Thanks,

To run:

1. Clone the repo
2. Go the directory
3. run ```npm install```
4. run ```npm start```

I get an error :( No problem!

Use this ```npm install react-scripts --save```
